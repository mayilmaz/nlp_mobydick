## Word Frequency Analysis in Moby Dick using NLP

This repo contains the code for word frequency analysis in the classic novel Moby Dick using Natural Language Processing tools.
After getting the text of the novel from a publicly accessible html page, the steps of wrangling and tokenizing the text were performed. Later, common stopwords in English language were used to filter out the text in order to clearly count the most used words within the novel.

Further explanations are included in Jupyter notebook.
